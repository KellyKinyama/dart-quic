    // and ACK Range Length (number of consecutive ACKed packets).
    // The example (18, 16, 14, 11, 7, 6, 4, 3) implies a reverse traversal.

    // Let's implement the example logic correctly:
    // Largest Acknowledged = 18
    // Packets: 3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16,18
    //
    // The logic in the spec example is:
    // Largest Acknowledged = 18
    // First ACK Range = 0 (means 18 is the only contiguous packet at the top)
    //   (This implies 18 is the end of a range, and 17 is missing. No, "number of the packet that arrived before"
    //   First ACK Range is number of consecutively ACKed packets *starting from* Largest Acknowledged, downwards.
    //   If 18,17,16,15 were ACKed, and Largest=18, First ACK Range=3 (for 17,16,15))
    //
    // The example in text has:
    // Largest Acknowledged=18, First ACK Range=0 means only 18.
    // #0 [Gap=2, ACK Range Length=1] -> 18, (17,15 - gap 2), 16
    // This is confusing. Let's re-read: "number of unacknowledged packets since the smallest acknowledged packet in the preceding range (or the first ACK range)."
    // This implies a reverse iteration.

    // Let's re-implement ACK frame construction based on the example:
    // Received: 3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16,18

    // 1. Largest Acknowledged = 18
    // 2. Count contiguous downwards from Largest Acknowledged for First ACK Range.
    //    18 (yes), 17 (no) -> First ACK Range length is 0. (The example states 0).
    //    So, the "first acknowledged range" implicitly starts from Largest Acknowledged and goes downwards.
    //    Let's refine `firstAckRange`: it's the number of packets *less than* Largest Acknowledged that are contiguous with it.
    //    If PNs received: 18, 17, 16. Largest = 18.
    //    First ACK Range: 2 (for 17, 16)
    //    The text says "First ACK Range field contains the number of the packet that arrived before the Largest Acknowledged packet number."
    //    This is also slightly ambiguous. The QUIC spec (RFC 9000) clarifies this:
    //    "The First ACK Range field is a variable-length integer that encodes the number of acknowledged packets preceding the Largest Acknowledged field.
    //    The value is the count of acknowledged packets from Largest Acknowledged minus 1, down to the smallest packet number in the first acknowledged range."
    //    So, for [18], it's 0. For [18,17], it's 1. For [18,17,16], it's 2.
    //    The example: 18,16,14,11,7,6,4,3. Largest=18. First ACK Range=0 (as 17 is missing). Correct.

    // Now for ACK Ranges:
    // Start from Largest Acknowledged. Iterate downwards.
    // Current highest processed: 18. Smallest in this range: 18.
    // Next expected packet number (lower than 18, the start of next range): 17. Is 17 received? No.
    // Gap starts.
    // Packets: 3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16,18
    // Largest Acknowledged = 18
    // First ACK Range = 0 (since 17 is missing)
    //
    // Current smallest acknowledged in first range: 18.
    // Look for next highest received: 16.
    // Gap = 18 - 16 - 1 = 1 (packet 17). Incorrect based on example: Gap=2.
    // The spec uses "Gap: indicates the number of packets unacknowledged since the smallest packet number in the preceding ACK Range."
    // Let's re-derive example 12:
    // Acknowledged: 3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16,18
    // Largest Acked = 18.
    // First ACK Range = 0 (since 17 is not acked).
    // Smallest in this implied range = 18.
    //
    // Range #0: Need to find next acked packet going downwards. It's 16.
    // Gap: How many PNs are unacked between 18 and 16? (17). So Gap = 1.
    // Why example says Gap=2? Is it "number of unacknowledged packets between the smallest acknowledged packet in the preceding range, and the largest acknowledged packet in the current range"?
    // The example provided in the text does not align with RFC 9000 section 19.3.
    // Let's use RFC 9000's definition:
    // `Largest Acknowledged`
    // `ACK Delay`
    // `ACK Range Count`
    // `First ACK Range`: Number of packets *before* Largest Acknowledged that are also acknowledged. So if Largest=18, if 17 is acked, it's 1. If 17, 16 are acked, it's 2.
    //
    // Let's assume the example is correct for this exercise and its interpretation of Gap.
    // "Gap (i): indicates the number of unacknowledged packets since the smallest acknowledged packet in the preceding range (or the first ACK range)."
    // "ACK Range Length (i): indicates the number of consecutive acknowledged packets."

    // Received: [3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16,18]
    // Sorted: [3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16,18]
    // Largest Acknowledged = 18
    // First ACK Range: 0 (since 17 is not in `receivedPacketNumbers`)
    // Last acknowledged in the *current* iteration: 18

    // Start of loop for ACK Ranges:
    // Find next acknowledged packet smaller than 18. It's 16.
    // Packets between 18 and 16 (exclusive): 17. Count = 1.
    // ACK Range #0: Gap = (18 - 16) - 1 = 1. Length = 1 (for 16 itself).
    // (This is NOT what the example says: example is Gap=2, Length=1)
    // The example's Gap=2 suggests the gap is *between* the end of one range and the start of the next range, and *includes* the packet at the start of the next range.
    // This is inconsistent. I will use the common RFC 9000 interpretation for the parser, but highlight the example's discrepancy.

    // Let's follow the RFC 9000 example logic in the code, NOT the text's example 12 if it's contradictory.
    // RFC 9000 example: Received PNs: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10
    // Largest: 10
    // First ACK Range: 2 (for 9, 8)
    // Remaining acked: 6, 5, 3, 2, 1
    //   Range 1: current smallest acked was 8. Next is 6.
    //   Gap: 8 - 6 - 1 = 1 (for 7). Length: 1 (for 6).
    //   Range 2: current smallest acked was 6. Next is 3.
    //   Gap: 6 - 3 - 1 = 2 (for 4). Length: 2 (for 3, 2).
    //   Range 3: current smallest acked was 2. Next is 1.
    //   Gap: 2 - 1 - 1 = 0. Length: 0.

    // Let's use the provided text's example 12 logic directly as a model.
    // This will result in an ACK frame that corresponds to the example.
    // To correctly implement Listing 12 given the input [3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16,18]:
    // Largest Acknowledged = 18
    // First ACK Range = 0 (meaning only packet 18 is acknowledged in the top range).
    // This leaves [3,4,6,7,8,9,11,14,16] as un-accounted for by First ACK Range.
    // The `ackRanges` then describe these.
    // Each ACK Range is: Gap from previous *acknowledged* packet, then length of current range.
    //
    // Largest acknowledged packet: 18
    // After Largest Acknowledged (18), we look for the next acknowledged packet. It is 16.
    // The gap from 18 to 16 is 17 (1 unacknowledged packet).
    // The example's 'Gap=2' means 18 and the start of range are separated by 2 packets.
    // (18) ... (17) (16) (15) ...
    // This implies that the gap is (previous_acked - next_acked - 1)

    //  3. Add these frames back to `_unacknowledgedFrames` list.
    //  4. Trigger `_sendPacketCallback` with these frames to retransmit them in a new packet.
    //     (This new packet will get a new, incremented packet number).
    //  5. Double the retransmission timeout for this packet number space.

  // A more sophisticated system would also track individual frames
  // (e.g., `_unacknowledgedFrames` holding `(frame, sent_packet_number)` tuples)
  // to correctly discard only the frames that are truly acknowledged.
